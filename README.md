## Project Overview

AgriEdge Or-Mange Ltd, a leading company in the agriculture and food production sector, is modernizing its order management processes through a Salesforce-driven **Order Management System (OMS)**. Operating in a fast-paced industry, the company requires efficient order processing, accurate inventory tracking, and exceptional customer service to maintain a competitive edge.
